Trekking for over 8 hours, the team withstood rains, haze and biting cold wind to reach the top of the pass. Nestled in the mountains of the Zanskar valley, hte first sights of the camp site after the physical exhausting journey rejuvenated every team member in its own way!</div>

Our halt for the day was at Sumdo Chenmo, a village which can only be reached after 2 days of trek. Our team decided to light up the village by offering Solar Lanterns to them. A village tucked in the darkness of Zanskar ranges got its first glimpse of light. Separated from any electricity lines, these lamps would ensure the villagers have light in the night.</div>

We camped the night at Chilling, a stone's throw away from the Indus river.</div>

After having some hot tea and snacks at Khardungla, and clicking quite a few snaps for the instagram album, we headed back to Leh, were we then attended the city's first TEDx event. We headed out to the city market soon after, for some last minute souvenir shopping, while trying hard to reconcile with the fact that the next day would have us all flying off in different directions.

                                    There are moments in life which make you realize that there is much more in you as an individual than what you are currently.  I have always heard such stories where people said that certain experiences in life changed them. Now, through GHE, I have lived such a story. Since coming back from GHE, I am running marathons, going on cycling expeditions, volunteering for causes; in the process discovering a new side of me, which I am really enjoying.

                                    GHE was the experience of a lifetime. To be able to meet such interesting and well-rounded people from all across the globe - from the CEO of the biggest solar power company in India to people who had travelled from the North Pole to the South Pole on bamboo bikes, in a place as stunning as Ladakh, while setting up a fully functioning e-base running 100% on solar power, all in one trip - crazy! I went alone, I came back with amazing memories, great friends and buckets full of inspiring ideas. I went a sceptic, I came back a believer.

                                    Everything I had went through in the last few days has been all firsts - first time trekking in the Himalayas, first time camping, first time cycling through the mountains. I can’t believe I am here, having finished all this, and I am actually now ready to go on again.

                                    I had come with no expectations at all, had come just to see Leh, meet some great people. But the impact that I have seen GHE make is profound, from setting up the Education Base and seeing the children smile when they were using the tablets and the internet for the first time, to going to one of the villages and distributing solar lanterns, where they have never had electricity before. These things have made a big difference in my life...
