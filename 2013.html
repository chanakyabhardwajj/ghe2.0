We had lunch with a local family in a hamlet nearby and spent the afternoon plucking apricots in their garden. From here, we drove to the scenic Lamayuru monastery, which would be our stop for the day.

                                        There are moments in life which make you realize that there is much more in you as an individual than what you are currently.  I have always heard such stories where people said that certain experiences in life changed them. Now, through GHE, I have lived such a story. Since coming back from GHE, I am running marathons, going on cycling expeditions, volunteering for causes; in the process discovering a new side of me, which I am really enjoying.

To be able to meet such interesting and -rounded people from all across the globe - from the CEO of the biggest solar power company in India to people who had travelled from the North Pole to the South Pole on bamboo bikes, in a place as stunning as Ladakh, while setting up a fully functioning e-base running 100% on solar power, all in one trip - crazy! I went alone, I came back with amazing memories, great friends and buckets full of inspiring ideas. I went a sceptic, I came back a believer.

                                        I had come with no expectations at all, had come just to see Leh, meet some great people. But the impact that I have seen GHE make is profound, from setting up the Education Base and seeing the children smile when they were using the tablets and the internet for the first time, to going to one of the villages and distributing solar lanterns, where they have never had electricity before. These things have made a big difference in my life...
