Squeezing ourselves into our wetsuits and arming ourselves with colorful oars, we broke up into groups that would mount the rafts kept ready for us. Guided by experts, and steered by our own mad adrenaline rush, we flowed along with the river, through the rough patches and the calm ones in the Zanskar river.</div>

                            <div class="carousel-caption justify">Back to Leh, we set out for Khardungla, the pass which boasts of the highest motorable road in the world. It was a quick drive up the mountains, and we could feel the rising altitude by the buzz in our ears. After having some hot tea and snacks at Khardungla, and clicking quite a few snaps for the instagram album, we headed back to Leh, were we then attended the city's first TEDx event. We headed out to the city market soon after, for some last minute souvenir shopping, while trying hard to reconcile with the fact that the next day would have us all flying off in different directions. If only great times could last forever</div>
