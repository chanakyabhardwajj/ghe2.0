                            There are moments in life which make you realize that there is much more in you as an individual than what you are currently.  I have always heard such stories where people said that certain experiences in life changed them. Now, through GHE, I have lived such a story. Since coming back from GHE, I am running marathons, going on cycling expeditions, volunteering for causes; in the process discovering a new side of me, which I am really enjoying.

To be able to meet such interesting and -rounded people from all across the globe - from the CEO of the biggest solar power company in India to people who had travelled from the North Pole to the South Pole on bamboo bikes, in a place as stunning as Ladakh, while setting up a fully functioning e-base running 100% on solar power, all in one trip - crazy! I went alone, I came back with amazing memories, great friends and buckets full of inspiring ideas. I went a sceptic, I came back a believer.
