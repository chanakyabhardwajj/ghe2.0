Acclimatizing to the altitude, we take rest in the comfortable Mongolian huts, and venture out to the city market in evening for a casual tour.

We camped the night by the lake-side, observing the clear night sky devoid of any light pollution, and seeing stars there which we never knew existed.

We stopped by at the Hemis monastery on the way, where we got a glimpse into Ladakh’s rich history and religious traditions, and also a chance to interact with the monks.

We had lunch with a local family in a hamlet nearby and spent the afternoon plucking apricots in their garden. From here, we drove to the scenic Lamayuru monastery, which would be our stop for the day.

We all were special invitees to the Morning Prayer in the monastery and it was an incredibly uplifting spiritual experience. After a quick walk through the town, we set off on our way, to reach our first campsite of the trek before loss of daylight.

Sure of our footing by now, we made quick progress through the rocky trails, reaching the village of Sumda Chenmo by afternoon. We spent the night there, and gifted the residents of the village, which doesn’t have any access to electricity, solar lanterns to light up their nights.

We camped the night at Chilling, a stone's throw away from the Indus River.

Squeezing ourselves into wetsuits and armed with colorful oars, we broke up into 3 groups that would mount the rafts kept ready for us. Guided by experts, and fueled by our own mad adrenaline rush, we flowed along with the Zanskar River, through the rough and calm patches.

We all then went out to the city market for some last minute souvenir shopping, while trying hard to reconcile to the fact that the amazing trip was coming to an end.

I have always heard such stories where people said that certain experiences in life changed them. Now, through GHE, I have lived such a story. Since coming back from GHE, I am running marathons, going on cycling expeditions, volunteering for causes; in the process discovering a new side of me, which I am really enjoying.

To be able to meet such interesting and -rounded people from all across the globe - from the CEO of the biggest solar power company in India to people who had travelled from the North Pole to the South Pole on bamboo bikes, in a place as stunning as Ladakh, while setting up a fully functioning e-base running 100% on solar power, all in one trip - crazy! I went alone, I came back with amazing memories, great friends and buckets full of inspiring ideas. I went a sceptic, I came back a believer.
