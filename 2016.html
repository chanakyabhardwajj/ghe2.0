                                The Global Expedition Trek is moderate. This means you will often venture into more remote country and will cross mountain passes. Altitudes are relatively low, reaching no higher than 4,900m/16,300ft. The trek is suitable for anyone who loves hill walking
                                and leads a healthy, active lifestyle. As a minimum we recommend you start training four to six weeks prior to the trip, walking for at least 3km, three times a week.

                                seen, it is said that in Ladakh one can get sun stroke and frost bite at the same time! This tells us a lot about the type of weather that you must expect.
