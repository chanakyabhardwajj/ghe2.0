                                Every great journey eventually comes to an end, but not before paving way for an even better one the next time.
                                <br><br> GHE 2016 was an amazing, one of its kind, expedition that light up the 2500 year
                                old Phugtal Monastery. GHE 2017 promises to be even better and bigger.
                                <br><br> Spread over 15 days, packed with all kinds of action, from lighting up the remotest
                                village in Himalayas, to 9 days of trekking, 2 days of Grade 4 Rafting, 1 day of mountain
                                biking and camping in some of the most picturesque locations in the world, the trip promises
                                all of what is a once in a lifetime experience.

                                <br><br> Lack of access to electricity has been one of the major challenges faced by these
                                communities. For the last 2 years, GHE has been focusing towards creating a sustainable off
                                grid power generation solutions for these thousand-year-old villages located at an altitude
                                of over 12000ft. Till date, GHE has brought electricity to 25 remote Himalayan villages.

                                <br><br> This year, in June 2017, team GHE plans to lighten up the remotest village of Ladakh
                                nestled in the Zanskar valley called Village Shade. The village comprises of 16 Households
                                with a population of 80. The task of electrification will be completed with a carefully selected
                                team of 25 individuals from all over the Globe.

                                <br><br> Listed below are the key highlights of the June 2017 expedition

                                The Global Himalayan Expedition Trek is challenging and hard. This means you will often venture into more remote country
                                and will cross mountain passes above 17000ft. Trekking altitudes are relatively at average
                                around 14000ft. The trek is suitable for anyone who has trekked for longer days before and
                                have had experience in trekking in high altitude areas. The expedition also involves a day
                                of mountain biking on rough mountain road and Rafting for 2 days at Grade V rapids. GHE encourages
                                only fit and experienced candidates to apply for GHE 2017.

                                be ready for inclement weather in any case as weather has become highly unpredictable and
                                can change quickly at altitudes. As comically seen, it is said that in Ladakh one can get
                                sun stroke and frost bite at the same time! This tells us a lot about the type of weather
                                that you must expect.
