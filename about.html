                    <p class="lead">
                        The Himalayas have always been the force inspiring and guiding humanity ahead. Right from the early Gods of Hinduism, to many great Buddhist saints, and recently the greatest idols of the Music and Technology world like the Beatles and Steve Jobs, all have drawn from these mountains a great deal of what they later gave back to the world .The purpose of this expedition is to have the Holistic Himalayan Experience, stretching across pure adventure and cultural connect with the local communities to setting up sustainable energy and education based infrastructure in these remote regions. We don’t see ourselves in the field of running expeditions; we see ourselves as facilitators, whose job is to create a fertile environment for future growth and collaborations, for both the participants and the hosts. Dubbed as the Adventure Pilgrimage, we just try to get you to the mountains, and let the peaks inspire you.

                        The Himalayas have always been the force inspiring and guiding humanity ahead. Right from the early Gods of Hinduism, to many great Buddhist saints, and recently the greatest idols of the Music and Technology world like the Beatles and Steve Jobs, all have drawn from these mountains a great deal of what they later gave back to the world . When treading through their vastness, minor issues and frivolous thoughts vanish away, and what you are left with is what defines your core.<br>
                        <br>The purpose of this expedition is to have the Holistic Himalayan Experience, stretching across pure adventure and cultural connect with the local communities to spiritual awakening of oneself. Dubbed as the Adventure Pilgrimage, what this does is connect us with our physical, emotional and spiritual selves.<br>
                        <br>The expedition revolves around three different modes of negotiating the terrain – biking, trekking and rafting, which we refer to as the Triadventure. Throughout the journey we also make a concerted effort in connecting with the local community. Having grown up with the peaks as their play-mates, every Ladakhi has countless stories of survival and endurance to share. Humbled by the constant vigil of the giants and their volatile moods, the communities have learnt to adapt and live in a way which is responsive to nature.<br>
                        <br>Every second spent on these slopes are moments of looking into the proverbial mirror, reflecting on our past, present and future, which quite curiously lay themselves out before us. The spiritual experience of the Himalayas can’t be explained in words, because language becomes inadequate in describing the vastness of the experience and the depth of its effect. Come over to experience the world’s oldest search engine – the Search Engine for the soul.

                            We are a group of people from diverse backgrounds, who fell in love with the same lady – the snow clad peaks of Himalayas. The Global Himalayan Expedition is a result of our yearning to share this great experience with the rest of the world. You would find the hyperactive bunch of individuals below, debating over a cup of chai or designing something new for the web, when not working together to make this expedition possible.
