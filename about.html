                            The Himalayas have always been the force inspiring and guiding humanity ahead. Right from the early Gods of Hinduism, to many great Buddhist saints, and recently the greatest idols of the Music and Technology world like the Beatles and Steve Jobs, all have drawn from these mountains a great deal of what they later gave back to the world .The purpose of this expedition is to have the Holistic Himalayan Experience, stretching across pure adventure and cultural connect with the local communities to setting up sustainable energy and education based infrastructure in these remote regions. We don’t see ourselves in the field of running expeditions; we see ourselves as facilitators, whose job is to create a fertile environment for future growth and collaborations, for both the participants and the hosts. Dubbed as the Adventure Pilgrimage, we just try to get you to the mountains, and let the peaks inspire you.

                            We are a group of people from diverse backgrounds, who fell in love with the same lady – the snow clad peaks of Himalayas. The Global Himalayan Expedition is a result of our yearning to share this great experience with the rest of the world.

And when he did ask himself that question, travelling and writing were the answers that seemed obvious. Being in a job which encourages him to think creatively, Gokul lets some of that overflow into his work with GHE in the weekends, where he helps in leading the thought process on the brand's personality and how it speaks out to its participants and followers. Refuelling every few hours on endless cups of freshly brewed coffee, you can find this guy trying to paint with words, and using powerpoint to come up with vividly eloquent imagery.

                                <p class="pull-left justify">Robert Swan, OBE is one of the world’s preeminent polar explorers and environmental leaders. By age 33, Swan became the first person to walk to both the North and South Poles, earning his place in history alongside the great explorers and adventurers. Swan’s experiences of the effects of global warming at both Poles only helped to shape and focus his lifetime goal: working towards the preservation of Antarctica as the last great wilderness on earth. In 1992,Robert Swan, OBE was the Keynote Speaker at the first ‘World Summit for Sustainable Development’ held in Rio de Janeiro. In March 2008, Robert Swan, OBE made Antarctic history again by living solely on renewable energy at the E-Base for over two weeks. Successful in the world’s harshest climate, the positive message Swan sent to the world was “This is possible in Antarctica, and surely it is possible in the ‘real world’!”. Swan’s contribution to education and the environment has been recognized on an international scale, seen through his appointment as United Nations Goodwill Ambassador for Youth and Special Envoy to the Director General of UNESCO. He was awarded the high distinction of OBE, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, as well as the Polar Medal by Her Majesty the Queen.
