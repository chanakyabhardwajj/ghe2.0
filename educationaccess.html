            <div class="content">Bounded by high mountains on all sides, Ladakh is one of the most remote regions of India. It is classified by
                geographers as high-altitude desert, and with settlements ranging from altitudes of 8,000 to 12,000 feet,
                it is often described as a “hostile environment.” Yet Ladakh has for many centuries been host to thriving
                communities of small farmers and pastoralists, including families that have been cultivating the same patches
                of land for over 600 years, and nomadic herders on the Changthang plains near the border with Tibet. Majority
                of the Ladakhi people live in villages that are scattered in between the high mountains and most of these
                villages lack proper transport, communication, education and other basic facilities like medicine. Illiteracy
                and ignorance has been the bane of these simple folk for ages. With the development of Leh town and the villages,
                education also gained importance however there are still many problems caused by a gap in what is written
                versus what the students see. The examples used in the textbooks have no connect to the local community and
                students find it difficult to grasp the concepts which are not related to their community. The teachers are
                also not well trained and this limits their capabilities to fully tap into the potential of the young minds.

            <div class="content">GHE is working on two primary focus areas promoting access to Experiential Education for the remote mountain
                communities.
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide Experiential Education to school Students with Hands on Project</li>
                    <li>Setup Solar Based advanced Himalayan Innovation Centres</li>
                </ul>
                Himalayan Innovation Centres: HIC are being setup in the rural areas, where students from different villages come together
                at one central village and access knowledge that opens up their minds to a world of possibilities. This is
                achieved through innovation in technology by which GHE is able to provide these remote children access to
                offline internet. </div>

                Third Pole Education Base was setup by GHE in 2013 at 12000 ft In Leh, with the intent to provide interactive and experiential
                learning for the students of Ladakh. students who come to the Leh city from all the different villages, and
                to expand their learning horizon beyond the textbooks through practical hands on experimental knowledge and
                through connecting with the outside world via internet. 500 students of Leh now use the E-Base as part of
                their curriculum, focusing on education, based on sustainable solutions around clean energy, waste management,
                water conservation, bio-diversity and local Ladakhi culture & traditions. The projects done by the students
                at the EBase have won the Design for Change Award for two years in a row in 2014 and 2015, competing against
                2500 different schools from all over India and winning the coveted ‘I CAN’ Award.

                The Third Pole Education Base has ignited a passion within the students to take up careers in arts, science, engineering
                and move away from the traditional approach of being in the tourism industry. There has been an increase
                in the overall skill development of the students

            <div class="content">
                In 2016, GHE focused on setting up Innovation Centres in Ladakh powered by Solar Technology. The centres have been set up
                in rural schools that have no mobile and internet connectivity. These centres are setup with the aim of promoting
                digital literacy among the village students. GHE has introduced Linux/windows OS based low power computers
                (&lt;12W) with energy efficient LED monitors and satellite connection for internet access. The Himalayan
                Innovation Centres comprise on average six fully fledged systems that require less than 150W of power for
                10 hours of operation. This is a perfect demonstration of how a high-performance energy efficient system
                can provide digital education for remote schools and it has had a hugely motivating impact on the students.
