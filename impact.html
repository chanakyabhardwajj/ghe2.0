                        <div class="description"> The Third Pole Educational Base (E-Base), setup in Ladakh, is a one of its kind social impact initiative which marries the twin objectives of quality education disbursement and creation of awareness on sustainable practices. Setup in a region which has been experiencing the grave consequences of climate change- the Cloud Burst floods in 2010 and receding glaciers which are cutting away water sources - the E-Base is meant to be a model of sustainability while also being a portal for the children from the region to connect with the outside world. The E-Base is constructed completely out of renewable material, using a technique called ‘Rammed Earth’, and is powered entirely by solar panels. <br><br> The E-Base is located in the Mahabodhi complex in Leh, right next to the Mahabodhi Residential School which is home to students from some of the remotest corners of the Himalayas. The E-Base houses a robotics lab, digital library of documentaries, interactive learning tools, star gazing kit and is capable of connecting to other institutions around the world through video conferencing. <br><br> In less than two years since it was setup (in August 2013), the E-Base has seen a flurry of activities which have redefined the education scene in Leh. The E-Base has a strategic partnership with Ashley School in the UK, and the students have benefitted from frequent group Skype sessions with their peers on the other side of the globe. Richard Dunne, the principal of Ashley School and an acclaimed educator, visited the E-Base and conducted training sessions for the teachers on modern educational practices. The E- Base got an enthusiastic fellow in Neha Singh last year, as part of the E-Base Fellowship program. Neha stayed in the school and over a period of 4 months initiated both the children and the teachers into a new model of interactive and activity based learning. Neha’s efforts and the children’s enthusiasm translated into the E-Base winning the National Design for Change challenge in 2014 for their ingenious approach to waste management in the school. The E-Base has also been a venue for career counseling sessions for the children organized by Yuvshaala. There are many more interesting events lined up at the E-Base this year.

                            As part of our GHE 2013 trek route we stayed one night in a remote village in the Zanskar valley called Sumda Chenmo. The village is a 3 day trek from the nearest signposts of civilization, and as the sun set over the mountains that evening the whole village was bathed in darkness. Being in a remote and harsh terrain, the village had no hope of ever being connected to a conventional electric grid. <br><br> That night in August 2013 we gifted the villagers of Sumda Chenmo with solar lanterns as a mark of our respect for their hospitality. As the solar lanterns lit up the night, the happiness in the faces of the villagers was palpable. That made us decide to come back here again the next year with a more permanent cure for the darkness – their own independent self-sustaining micro-grid.<br><br> When we reached Sumda Chenmo again in August 2014, we had carried alongwith us on the trek all the raw material required to setup the micro-grid – solar panels on horseback, LED bulbs, wiring, sockets, batteries, inverters and lot of nails and hammers. The whole micro-grid was setup in a day by the GHE participants, with help from the enthusiastic villagers. The sunset on August 18th was a special one for the village, as it was accompanied by 121 light bulbs going on across the village, as the micro-grid became operational. Now, even after half an year from that date, the grid continues to power the lives and dreams of the villagers.<br><br> Some of the benefits the grid has brought in are: <ul> <li>The microgrid completely eliminated usage of 1600 litres of kerosene (amounting to around 4000kgs of CO2) from the entire village.</li> <li>It extended the working hours of the villagers by 4hrs/day, where major occupation is brass and copper work and local handicrafts.</li> <li>It helped the villagers escape poisonous fumes generated through use of oil lamps used for lighting.</li> <li>Increased income generation by making the village a more attractive destination for home stays. Now trekkers passing through the village prefer to stay in the village homes that provide them with light and charging facilities.</li> <li>The grid also supports a DC LED television (TV), specially designed for this project, that brings the community together for special screening of movies based on social issues.</li> There is more planned for Sumda Chenmo this year, and we would keep you updated about it on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GlobalHimalayanExpedition">Facebook page</a>. </ul>
