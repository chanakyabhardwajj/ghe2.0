                            The Third Pole E-Base, setup in Ladakh, is the 3rd such E-Base in the world. Setup in a region which has experienced grave consequences of climate change, like the Cloud Burst in 2010 and receding glaciers which are cutting away water sources, the E-Base is meant to be a model of sustainability while also being a portal for the kids from the region to connect to the outside world. The E-Base is constructed completely out of renewable material, using a technique called ‘Rammed Earth’, and is powered entirely by solar panels.

                            The E-Base is located in the Mahabodhi complex in Leh, right next to the Mahabodhi School. It houses a digital library of documentaries and interactive learning tools and is capable of connecting to other institutions around the world through video conferencing. In addition to this, there are multiple tablets available, which the students can use to research about new concepts. The idea is to make learning a more engaging and enriching experience, while empowering the students of this region with tools which are now commonplace in other urban communities.

                            Most of the villages in the Himalayas are yet to encounter their first wave of electrification. During our journey this year, we would be taking our first steps to make a difference in this regard. The GHE team would set-up a micro-grid in one of the remote villages of the region, powered exclusively by solar energy. The houses in this village would be equipped with basic lighting infrastructure, and charging provisions for small appliances.
                            The introduction of even a limited source of electrical power can have immediate and significant economic, educational, and health benefits —by providing high-quality, non-polluting lighting; something which has been a commodity in the rest of the world for more than a decade now, but still is a luxury in these regions. Better illumination provides more opportunities for income generation; the villagers can now work during the evening/nights, and engage in activities such as traditional handicrafts, and wool weaving to supplement household income.
                            We see this as a first step towards electrifying many more such villages and would be undertaking this project with the technical support of one of the nodal renewable energy agencies of Ladakh.
