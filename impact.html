                            The Third Pole E-Base, setup in Ladakh, is the 3rd such E-Base in the world. Setup in a region which has experienced grave consequences of climate change, like the Cloud Burst in 2010 and receding glaciers which are cutting away water sources, the E-Base is meant to be a model of sustainability while also being a portal for the kids from the region to connect to the outside world. The E-Base is constructed completely out of renewable material, using a technique called ‘Rammed Earth’, and is powered entirely by solar panels.
                            <br>The E-Base is located in the Mahabodhi complex in Leh, right next to the Mahabodhi School. It houses a digital library of documentaries and interactive learning tools and is capable of connecting to other institutions around the world through video conferencing. In addition to this, there are multiple tablets available, which the students can use to research about new concepts. The idea is to make learning a more engaging and enriching experience, while empowering the students of this region with tools which are now commonplace in other urban communities.

                            Sumda Chenmo is a small village nestled in the Zanskar valley, and is 2 days of trek away from the nearest inhabited town. Because of its remoteness, the village isn’t part of any electric grid, and has never had any constant source of lighting.
                            The trek through the Hidden Valley passes through this village, where the Global Himalayan Expedition team stayed overnight, under the warm hospitality of the villagers. We had carried with us 15 solar lanterns, sponsored by Luminous India, which we handed over to the ladies of the 10 families there. When fully charged under sunlight, each lantern lasts around 10 hours, and is enough to light up the homes during the night. What shone brighter than the lanterns though, that night, were the smiles on the villagers’ faces.

                            Most of the villages in the Himalayas are yet to encounter their first wave of electrification. During our journey this year, we would be taking our first steps to make a difference in this regard. The GHE team would set-up a micro-grid in one of the remote villages of the region, powered exclusively by solar energy. The houses in this village would be equipped with basic lighting infrastructure, and charging provisions for small appliances.
                            The introduction of even a limited source of electrical power can have immediate and significant economic, educational, and health benefits —by providing high-quality, non-polluting lighting; something which has been a commodity in the rest of the world for more than a decade now, but still is a luxury in these regions. Better illumination provides more opportunities for income generation; the villagers can now work during the evening/nights, and engage in activities such as traditional handicrafts, and wool weaving to supplement household income.
                            We see this as a first step towards electrifying many more such villages and would be undertaking this project with the technical support of one of the nodal renewable energy agencies of Ladakh.

                            This August, the team of Global Himalayan Expedition is going to embark on a clean energy journey in an Electric Powered Vehicle (EPV). The journey would stretch from Delhi to Leh, passing through the beautiful valleys of Srinagar, and the treacherous passes of Zojila and Kargil. Sir Robert Swan, the first person to have walked to both the north and south poles, will be joining us on this journey. The idea behind the journey is to demonstrate that if an electric powered vehicle could travel through the tough Himalayan terrain to reach Ladakh, then it could be used anywhere else too.

                            <br>The Electric Powered Vehicle (EPV) will be driven upto the Mahabodhi campus in Leh, where it would be used as a clean intra-city passenger transport vehicle, especially for the students on the campus.

                            <br>We are in the process of finalizing the sponsor partners who will help us with the technology and logistics. If you or your firm maybe interested in working with us on this initiative, please get in touch with us.
