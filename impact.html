                        <div class="description"> The Third Pole Educational Base (E-Base), setup in Ladakh, is a one of its kind social impact initiative which marries the twin objectives of quality education disbursement and creation of awareness on sustainable practices. Setup
                            in a region which has been experiencing the grave consequences of climate change- the Cloud Burst floods in 2010 and receding glaciers which are cutting away water sources - the E-Base is meant to be a model of sustainability
                            while also being a portal for the children from the region to connect with the outside world. The E-Base is constructed completely out of renewable material, using a technique called ‘Rammed Earth’, and is powered entirely
                            by solar panels.
                            <br>
                            <br> The E-Base is located in the Mahabodhi complex in Leh, right next to the Mahabodhi Residential School which is home to students from some of the remotest corners of the Himalayas. The E-Base houses a robotics lab, digital
                            library of documentaries, interactive learning tools, star gazing kit and is capable of connecting to other institutions around the world through video conferencing.
                            <br>
                            <br> In less than two years since it was setup (in August 2013), the E-Base has seen a flurry of activities which have redefined the education scene in Leh. The E-Base has a strategic partnership with Ashley School in the UK, and
                            the students have benefitted from frequent group Skype sessions with their peers on the other side of the globe. Richard Dunne, the principal of Ashley School and an acclaimed educator, visited the E-Base and conducted training
                            sessions for the teachers on modern educational practices. The E- Base got an enthusiastic fellow in Neha Singh last year, as part of the E-Base Fellowship program. Neha stayed in the school and over a period of 4 months initiated
                            both the children and the teachers into a new model of interactive and activity based learning. Neha’s efforts and the children’s enthusiasm translated into the E-Base winning the National Design for Change challenge in 2014
                            for their ingenious approach to waste management in the school. The E-Base has also been a venue for career counseling sessions for the children organized by Yuvshaala. There are many more interesting events lined up at the
                            E-Base this year. Please follow the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eBaseLadakh">E-Base Facebook page</a> here for instant updates.

                            Lack of access to electricity has been one of the major challenges faced by these communities. Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) seeks to provide clean energy access through solar power, thereby improving the living standards of the rural populace, located above 12000ft. and, in the remote Himalayan frontiers of India and bordering countries such as Pakistan and China. GHE’s objective is to implement the solution in a sustainable, scalable and environmentally beneficial manner,
                            leading to an overall development of the community while empowering local village population.
                            <br>
                            <br> For the last couple of years, GHE has been focusing towards creating a sustainable off grid power generation solutions for these thousand-year-old villages located at an altitude of over 12000ft. GHE has till date electrified
                            10 villages, setup 30 microgrids and impacting over 2000 lives in the process. Till now, GHE has identified around 70 Villages in the Ladakh and Kargil district where the government has no plans of grid based solar intervention
                            for the next 5-10 years. These villages are primarily small hamlets with 15-30 households. Because of its remoteness and its small size, the region doesn’t come under the priority list or purview of Govt. based electrification
                            schemes.
                            <br>
                            <br> GHE Plans to electrify 40 villages of the Ladakh Division and create atleast 100 Home stays in these villages put together. The focus is primarily in the Zanskar valley of Ladakh where the need is maximum due to its remoteness.
                            <br>
                            <br> GHE electrification focus will entail three components:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Energy Access – Provide Clean Energy based solutions for the remote off grid communities of Himalayas.</li>
                                <li>Renewable Energy – The energy provided would be renewable in nature and will benefit the environment and offset any consumption of Kerosene oil in the village.</li>
                                <li>Energy Efficiency – Most importantly, GHE focus is one energy efficiency. The objective is to provide maximum facilities in the least possible cost and provide maximum impact.</li>
                            </ol>
