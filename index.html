                                        Joining hands in an unknown land to bring electricity to the beautiful people of Sumdha Chenmo was an extraordinary experience; one which not only cultivated strong friendships but also showcased the power of the human spirit when we come together to achieve greater good.

                                        “To live is to travel” the famous writer and Dane H.C. Andersen said, and I couldn’t agree more with him. It describes perfectly the feeling I had during and after this unique and extraordinaire experience. It was challenging, fun, rewarding, amazing. Up there in the mountains you feel totally free and alive, a vivid and life enhancing experience without a doubt. It was tough, it was magical, it was a real adventure. The people we met on our way live a simple, uncomplicated life often battling with the elements and harsh landscape they are surrounded by and still they surrounded us with a warmth and a welcome that amazed. The times I shared with my fellow adventurers can never be taken away or forgotten.

                                        Very seldom are we given the opportunity to make a measurable impact in the world. To be part of a team that helped to set up solar grids in the village of Sumda Chenmo, and seeing the pure joy on the villagers' faces when we turned on the lights for the first time, is something I will never forget.

I can urge anyone who feels they want to do more with their life, to take the leap and join the cause of “improving sustainability worldwide” and GHE is the perfect place to start this journey.

                                        The journey you undertake with GHE, is a journey unlike any other.  As you are thrown against the bare and stark backdrop of the Himalayas, you learn to overcome your fears, challenge your limits and appreciate the beauty around you. In between conquering peaks and battling cold and sun, you befriend kindred spirits, and unite with those who were once strangers, to bring ‘light’ to a shared dream (Sumda Chenmo)!

As an Infrastructure professional, I am always looking to build bridges. It felt so fulfilling when we, as a team, were able to put something tangible on the ground; The E-Base. Yes, you will sweat. Yes, you will be in pain. Yes, you will smile!
