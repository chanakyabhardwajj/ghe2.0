                Mountain Homestays is an initiative by Global Himalayan Expedition to help preserve the cultural heritage and ensure sustainable
                progress of marginalized mountainous communities living in the remotest parts of the world through livelihood

                opportunities in the villages that have been solar electrified by Global Himalayan expedition team. The inflow
                of income would help the villagers improve their standard of living and help them maintain the solar lighting
                facilities installed in their village homes in a self-sustainable manner. The key focus areas are focused
                on livelihood improvements through:

                By promoting homestay based tourism and the local handicrafts from these solar electrified villages, the mountain home-stays
                initiative has not only connected them with the rest of the world but has also enabled the women of these
                villages to earn additional income and create a sustainable, scalable social enterprise. The access to energy
                has played a crucial role in positively impacting the women of these communities who now not only maintain
                these solar microgrids that provide electricity for their homestay but they also promote the lighting and
                charging facility, as a feature of their homestay, to attract trekkers. An innovative approach which has
                enabled these women to be actively involved in the economic activities of their households.
