                            2041 was founded by explorer, adventurer and lecturer Robert Swan, OBE, the first person to walk to both the North and South Poles. 2041 is dedicated to his goal to ensure the preservation of Antarctica, the Earth’s last great wilderness.

                            Robert Swan has dedicated his life to the preservation of the Antarctic wilderness and promoting recycling, renewable energy and sustainability to combat the effects of climate change through positive leadership. His 900-mile journey to the South Pole, ‘In the Footsteps of Scott,’ stands as the longest unassisted walk ever made on earth. Key initiatives include partnership since the early 1990s with the United Nations World Summit for Sustainable Development, and a wide range of global and local environmental missions which have inspired youth around the world to become sustainable leaders and promote the use of renewable energy. Since 2003, Swan has led annual expeditions to Antarctica with students and business executives to heighten awareness of the Antarctic and build advocacy to ensure its survival as a wilderness. His teams have also helped design and build the world’s first Antarctic renewable energy education station.  <br>
                            Swan has served as Special Envoy to the UNESCO Director General and as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Youth. In recognition of his work, Her Majesty the Queen awarded him the high distinction of OBE, Officer of the Order of the British Empire and the Polar Medal.

                            Community Solutions Initiative is a signature program of IEEE Power and Energy Society. CSI is committed to open-source design and delivery of energy solutions to the world’s poorest and most energy-deprived populations. Providing electricity to remote communities around the world is part of IEEE CSI’s mission, which started as a joint initiative of the IEEE Nuclear & Plasma Sciences.  Society (NPSS) and the IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES). IEEE CSI’s goal is to provide access to basic electrical services for 50 million of the world’s most impoverished people within 10 years.<br>

                            CSI partnered with the Global Himalayan Expedition in 2014, to setup a CSI Knowledge Center at the Third Pole E-Base in Leh. The knowledge center has been established to provide students of the school several platforms that will help them learn more about renewable energy and sustainability using easy to use solar and mechanical kits.
