                        IEEE Smart Village is a donor supported signature program of the IEEE Foundation with a vision to bring basic electrical and educational services to more than 50 million people by 2025. The program is currently serving more than 50,000 people through
                        local partners in Haiti, Cameroon, Nigeria, South Sudan, Kenya, Namibia, Zambia and India. IEEE Smart Village holistically supports local entrepreneurs in off-grid communities to grow electricity businesses of the scope and character
                        that best serve the specific needs of customers in those communities.
                        <br> In partnership with IEEE Smart Village, GHE’s objective is to implement the renewable energy and technology solutions in a sustainable, scalable and environmentally beneficial way—leading to an overall development of the remote
                        villages in the Ladakh and Zanskar regions of India.

                        2041 was founded by explorer, adventurer and lecturer Robert Swan, OBE, the first person to walk to both the North and South Poles. 2041 is dedicated to his goal to ensure the preservation of Antarctica, the Earth’s last great wilderness. Robert Swan
                        has dedicated his life to the preservation of the Antarctic wilderness and promoting recycling, renewable energy and sustainability to combat the effects of climate change through positive leadership. His 900-mile journey to the
                        South Pole, ‘In the Footsteps of Scott,’ stands as the longest unassisted walk ever made on earth. Since 2003, Swan has led annual expeditions to Antarctica with students and business executives to heighten awareness of the Antarctic
                        and build advocacy to ensure its survival as a wilderness. His teams have also helped design and build the world’s first Antarctic renewable energy education station.
                        <br> Swan has served as Special Envoy to the UNESCO Director General and as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Youth. In recognition of his work, Her Majesty the Queen awarded him the high distinction of OBE, Officer of the Order of the
                        British Empire and the Polar Medal.
                        <br> Every Year IAE Alumni joins GHE to take Robs Mission to the next level and be the part of change they want to see and experience.

                        It is this spirit of adventure that defines Woodland. Founded in Quebec, Canada, over twenty-five years ago, Woodland is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of extreme weather outdoor gear and outerwear. Ever since the beginning Woodland has successfully
                        brought together the power of the human will and the rewards of discovery. Woodland has imbibed this very spirit in each and every one of its products.
                        <br> Woodland has been GHE’s Integral Partner and supporter. Their Outdoor gear has played a major role in the success of our expedition every year. They have also been instrumental in helping GHE setup the Third Pole Education Base.
                        <br> Rightly Said, Woodland’s Products push the boundaries of innovation so that we can push the boundaries of exploration.
